## Intro

**October, 1807.** The place is *Hammeroy* a small island just off the southern Norwegian coast. It is an *outport* a stopover in case of bad weather and often the last stop before ships make their way across the North Sea to Denmark, Britain and beyond, and it's finest inn is popular amongst British captains, ferrying timber back to feed the British navy. The inn is run by the Widower Gabrielsen, and his three daughters, known for their beauty. One of them, Gina has even gotten engaged to an Englishman, who has built her a walled garden in one of the island's sheltered valleys, where she will spend all her free time, unless she stands scouting for his ship, the *Sea Crow*. Like her mother before her, she is rumored to have the gift of the sight, and many have seen her speak to the "subterraneans" (Norwegian fey spirits)

But all is not well.

War has come, a British fleet devastated the Danish-Norwegian navy at the battle of Copenhagen, and in their thirst for revenge, Norwegian fishermen and traders have converted their vessels to Privateers, hunting the strait of Skagerrak for easy, British prey.

This morning, a pair of cannon boats brought the *Sea Crow* as prize to the island, its crew slaughtered. Realising that her fiancee has died, Gina runs to the garden.
