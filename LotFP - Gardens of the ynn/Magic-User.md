# The Magic-User - Occult Scholar

Your mother died in childbirth. Your first memory was your father's hateful stare as you entered his library. Slowly he groomed you, initiating you into the mysteries of hell. By day, he would preach the word of god to his pious flock as the provost of your province, at night he prepared to sacrifice you to the Devil as Abraham would Isak to God, believing that it would bring your mother back to him. 
You took solace in your imaginary friendships, a menagerie of creaturs  who would offer comfort and companionship, teaching you spells and charms. When your father finally tried to pierce your heart with a sacrificial dagger, your words of power gave shape to them, and they dragged him off you, holding him to the ground as you picked up the dagger to end him. Now you travel, searching for more tidbits of arcane lore.

**Grasping Hand**
Duration: *1 Round/level*, Range: *10'/level*  --- 
A Grasping Hand can automatically grapple one opponent who fails their saving throw versus Paralyzation. Once he fails his saving throw, he will be held fast for the duration of the spell, and can be moved as the caster wishes at a movement rate of 60'. The “hand” has no physical form, so there is no way for allies to pry the “hand” loose and it will not block attacks made against the restrained creature.

**Power Word Kill**
Duration: *Instantaneous*, Range: *2.5'/caster level* ---
The caster utters a single word of power that instantly kills one or more creatures within a 20' diameter, whether the creatures can hear the word or not. This spell will kill multiple creatures if they have less than 11 Hit Points each, or the spell will  kill a single creature that has 60 Hit Points or less. A maximum of 120 Hit Points’ total of creatures can be killed. Any creature that has 61 or more Hit Points is unaffected by Power Word Kill. There is no saving throw against this spell.

**Animated Artwork**
Duration: *1 Round/level*, Range: *30'*
The caster can pull an object or creature depicted in a piece of art, such as a drawing, painting, etc., into the real world. The object can be used as if it were real (it now is!), and any creature or person seeing the object or creature will believe it to be the same as that depicted in the artwork, complete with the  full abilities of either the object or creature, but now under control of the caster. 

Note that the quality of the piece will affect the power of the creature or item in the real world. A
masterwork piece of art (defined as being worth  1,000+ sp) will yield perfect creations; a work of lesser, but still serviceable quality will provide creations that are only 50% as effective; and anything less (scribbles on paper!) will be at 25% effective ness. Drawing a quick serviceable doodle takes two  Rounds. Creating a masterwork piece of art takes weeks, if not months.
