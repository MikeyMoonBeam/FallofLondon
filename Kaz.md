## Events

### Discussion with Kaz

#### Frenzy
Kaz will try to target Toreadors, Ventrues or Malkavians with her *Spark of Rage* power. 

This is her Man + Pot (5) versus the target's Composure + Intelligence. If she succeeds this triggers a fury check at Difficulty three. She will focus the rage on the mortals. 

She will only try once for each player.

If this fails, she will try to convince them. If it succeeds she will try to flee while the character tears into a mortal.

Just before the mortal dies, a molotov cocktail will fly through a window.

#### Talk 

Kaz has the following points:

* Everyone
    * Why is Osric doing this? Cheap detective novel - something out of the strand magazine
    * Have you stopped to thinking what will happen?
* Brujahs, Caitiffs, Gangrels
    * Why are you here?
    * What about the mortals? - ideals they are letting the rich get richer
    * Join me?
* Ventrue
    * You will never be allowed to rise up in the ranks
* Toreador, Nosferatu
    * Why do you follow the instructions of these people? 
    * Don't you have anything better to do?

Outcomes - If the players as a group seem to switch sides, she will lean in conspiratorially and smile. But this is interrupted by the molotov attack.

If one or more of the players seem amenable she will leave a number. - It is the answering machine of "Kazabian Carpentry and Furniture".


### Molotov Attack

A molotov cocktail flies in through the window

#### Avoiding Molotov Cocktail

Dex + Athletics (Diff 2)

Damage 2 Aggravated 

The Pub is now *on fire* it is time to do Fear Frenzy (unless you are already frenzied)

If you have take damage you must first resist a frenzy of diff 2 and then after this has been resolved and the true horror of your predicament is made clear, you must make a diff 3 roll (Willpower)
 
#### Getting Out

Getting out of the pub without getting burnt is challenging: 

Complications:

* Stepping over fire
* Hurting onlookers
* Breaking windows



### Knife Attacks

As the (unfrenzied) players escape into the crowded street, they come into a new scene. Screaming and horror as a  two tracksuited men attack the crowd with machetes, already several people are lying bleeding on the floor (Diff 2 Hunger Frenzy), and a third is lighting another molotov.

#### Take down the attackers

See the stat blocks.  Jimal will have the cocktail ready. 

#### Escape with the crowds

Dex + Athletics to escape (Diff 3)

Complications:

* Trample someone (weak)
* Supernatural means to escape?
* Get separated


### Aftermath

Largest group of players is confronted by Kenneth - Underneath a bridge or something.

He introduces himself as a clanless inconnu and hands over the autopsy reports.  He intimates that a certain vampire must have done this, and also points them to a community outreach group the children attended.



## Community Outreach group

Church of  St. Anthony is on a main road near tower bridge. Late in the afternoon there is only a person manning the phones and creating care packages. This person is Florian, an italian it consultant, and enthralled by Ophelia.
