**Vampire London in 2023**

When considering what unlife is like in London, one thing is more important than anything else: ***They know***.


Exactly who *They* are, is less clear. All we know is that around 2008, GCHQ detected electronic communication patterns that laid bare the conspiracies that the vampir&es had engaged in to maintain their hold over society, finally unravelling the veil of secrets that had kept British Kindred safe for millennia.  Still keeping the existence of vampires secret, in 2012, a cabal of high ranking intelligence official funnelled anti-terrorism funding into an elite Met unit which systematically investigated, located and exterminated almost **every vampire in London**. Elder and neonate alike fell to the onslaught of humanity unleashed. The survivors fled or hid, leaving London to the mortals..
**Questions for player characters:**
Were you in London when it fell, if so, how did you survive?

If you are a more recent arrival, why did come here?

Knowing that the *Second Inquisition* relies on electronic communication, social media and other online activity track the Kindred, how do you keep yourself safe?

Enter **Wolfgang** and his brood. Arriving in London sometime before 2020, using Brexit and Covid as his cover, the Ventrue Elder went to war against the Second Inquisition using the means he knew best - *Bureaucracy*. Slowly insinuating himself into the lives minor, but key players in the police and civil service, he methodically demolished the anti-vampire units by reshuffling organisations, drafting new policies, reassigning personnel, slashing funding, and creating a little scandal here and there. Gradually, the vampire hunters found themselves isolated and without resources, and in some cases, disgraced and prosecuted.

**Questions for player characters:**
If you were in London at this time, did any of your mortal allies suffer?

If you were in London at this time, did you help in this endeavour?
