**What about the Malkavians?**

The clan of the moon would seem to be ripe pickings for the Second Inquisition. After all, if they can't hold on to their sanity, how can they fight off the hunters? However, they have not suffered worse than other clans, their uncanny perception and ability to hide amongst the herd keeps them safer than most.

Some, like "Sicko", eke out a vampiric existence on the fringes of both mortal and kindred society, unable to connect to another being for more than a fleeing moment. Baker Street's "Mina" represents those who seem capable of holding the curse of Malkav under check, rarely letting the mask of respectability slip to reveal the true extent of her derangements.
