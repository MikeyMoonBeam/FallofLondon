**Have you seen the Nosferatu?**

The Nosferatu are in hiding. When GCHQ and NSA hacked into SchrekNET, it looked as they would never recover as  MI5 spooks fed them disinformation while the Seond Inquisition's storm troopers crept up on their havens. It is true, they are seldom seen in London anymore, but their presence is felt. A brief glimpse on the Tube, a flash of movement at a sewer drain, and a whispered warning before dawn, the *horrors* have returned to do what they do best. They gather and sift through rumours, gossip and news, and then make sure that the right people learn what they should.  Soon they will be ready to come up from London's tunnels, but for now, *Lacrima* and her brood make sure that Wolfgang has all the information he needs to strike back at the enemies of the Camarilla.
