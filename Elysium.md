Social Combat between Walter/Rowan and Kaz

Kaz has Willpower of 7

Kaz will use her awe: Manipulation (3) + Presence (4) against the Primogen and the players (Effect on Primogen is that half of them will listen (i.e. +3 bonus to convince them))

If a player does the same, they will have to roll Manipulation + Presence - Each success is a member of the Primogen allows them to use one presence dot.

#### First round - 
Kaz highlights that borough market is a hotbed for rightwing extremist (brexit, left-behind white working class communities) (Intelligence 2 + Streetwise  4)

#### Second round - 
Kaz points out that she can hardly be responsible for the vanity of the Toreador bitch whose narcissism and attention-seeking behaviour caused this problem - she made the murder happen. 
(Manipulation (3) + Intimidation (+2))

#### Third round -
Kaz argues that the coterie should never have been there in the first place, that the area south of the river has always been her domain. (Charisma (3) + Etiquette (1))

#### Outcome

If the players win, Kaz is considered to be *fully* responsible for the breach of the masquerade. 
If the players lose, they are considered to have accidentally *endangered* the masquerade. They are put on probation. 


### Ophelia

#### Opening

* Echo points out that there are two issues in front of the primogen. Did Kaz breach  the masquerade by focusing the attention of the doctor / journalist on Ophelia's victims - and is Ophelia's feeding a risk in itself?

* Players will be able to present their findings.
* Kaz will challenge them about the doctor


#### Findings

If the players argue against Ophelia, she will be put on probation, if not she will be let off with a minor warning. 

Kaz is sentenced to death - Argues for the right to be blood hunted. 

Prince lets her go for 10 minutes, turns to the players and lets them know that whoever brings him her head will get a *major boon*


## Hunting Kaz

    * He is in the fetal position (Kaz used Dread Gaze against him)
    * Horrible monster - a woman who wasn't a woman 

* Kaz is on the top floor, an open floor office with a few desks and chairs around pillars that are intended to hold mortarboard etc broken windows covered in plastic.

* Kaz will monologue:


* If someone is downstairs or keeping an eye out, they will see a black Mini Cooper turn off its lights as it enters the alley the side alley is in. 

* Kaz shouts,"They are here!" and **Detective Stephen Mills** and **Brother Dougie Morgan** 

* If anyone keeps an active lookout they get to roll Resolve+Awareness (2success)
* If not, the players needs 4 successes on a wits+awareness roll
